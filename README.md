Sales Prediction using Python
# **Objective**
The specific objective of this project is to implement a machine learning model that predicts sales based on historical data and various features such as advertising spend, customer demographics, and seasonal trends.
# **Project Details**
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical sales data from various sources,
including company databases and public datasets.
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the dataset is suitable for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyze the data to identify trends, seasonality, and correlations between different features and sales figures.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that may enhance the model's predictive power, such as rolling averages and temporal variables.
5. **Model Selection and Training:** Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, XGBoost) and train the model using the prepared dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to ensure accuracy and reliability.
7. **Deployment:** Implement the model into business operations for real-time sales forecasting and decision-making support.


By following these steps, the project aims to deliver a comprehensive sales forecasting model that leverages the power of machine learning to provide actionable insights for businesses.
